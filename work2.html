        <h1>Vancouver Art Gallery Members Microsite</h1>
  <section class="section-overview">
    <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
    <h1 class="question-title">Choosing Our Company</h1>
    <p>Vancouver Art Gallery is a not-for-profit organization with its main support coming from members, individual donors,
      corporate funders, foundations, the City of Vancouver, the Province of British Columbia through the British Columbia Arts
      Council, and the Canada Council for the Arts.  </p>

    <p>When my team, Tiffany, Yumi, Monica, Mia, and I took an information design course conducted by Professor Russell Taylor,
      we were given a 3-week project to choose a local company, or organization with the aim of creating a microsite that will boost
      their traffic flow. Thus, as a team we decided to choose Vancouver Art Gallery. We came up with Art Opens, a members-exclusive 
      microsite aimed to prioritize members and give them access to new exhibitions, detailed art information, and first viewing access.
      I was responsible for translating research into actionable insights, and working on the website interactions. I also helped out in
       designing the website. </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Research</h2>
    <h1 class="question-title">Findings</h1>
    <p>VAG is a not-for-profit organization that has its main funding come from memberships; however, as we conducted our secondary
      research we came to the following findings. </p>
      <img src="img/VAG1.png" alt="participatory workshop questions" class="slide-pictures">
      <p>We found that offline attendance has tremendously decreased, while digital programs have encouraged more people to attend
        the gallery. Moreover, we came to find that the memberships have heavily decreased as well, which is a direct issue affecting
        VAG as that is where a part of their funding comes from.</p>
        <p>Through these findings, we began questioning how we could possibly attract and maintain members, in the long run,
          and while simultaneously increasing offline traffic flow to the gallery..</p>
        <h1 class="question-title">Framing</h1>
        <p>The findings were extremely general and had us stomped at how and what we could possibly do to achieve the goal we had set.
          One of our team members, Tiffany, is a member at VAG and she informed us that she will be attending a private member viewing
           of a newly exhibited artwork.  She told us that only an email is sent with an RSVP link, and the name of the art and artist.</p>

           <p>Thus, we decided to create a microsite that is exclusive to members which will allow them to view new currently exhibited
           artworks, and learn more about the artwork; as well as diving deeper into the artists story. Moreover, members get the chance
            to RSVP to view the artwork in the gallery before it is open to the general public.</p>

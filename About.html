    <h1>Hello! I'm Dana.</h1>
    <p>I am a UX Designer based in Vancouver, Canada with a background in <span class="highlight">writing, user research, and visual design.</span></p>

    <p>I am currently completing a Bachelors of Science at the School of Arts and Technology at the University of Simon Fraser.
      I began loving design in high school when my mom gave me my first, non-paid, job designing posters for events that her
      daycare hosted. I remember thoroughly enjoying the process of designing those posters and getting feedback on where things
      could be improved. Although looking back, those posters needed a lot of improving :) I also managed the daycares social medias
      creating a coherent layout and color scheme that is still used today by the new media design team! </p>

      <p>I worked in a variety of different fields after that such as a marketing associate and customer service representative;
        more can be found on my resume!  Overall, I would say that I am an extremely flexible and open minded person that can
        easily adapt in any workplace. <span class="highlight">I am currently looking for employment opportunities in the design field with the hopes of
        increasing my skills and learning the ins and outs of the design force. </span></p>
